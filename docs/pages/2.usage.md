## Vue composables

This module provides composables to use inside vour `vue` files. Those exposed composables are [auto-imported](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/composables) by Nuxt 3.

### `useSupabaseClient`

This composable is using [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/) under the hood, it gives acces to the [Supabase client](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/supabase-client).

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script setup>
const client = useSupabaseClient()

// Example: client.from('librairies').eq('name', 'Vue').single()
</script>
```

 1. Authentification

All authentification methods are available on [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signup) Documentation.

Here is an example of the login using the `signIn` method with [third-party providers](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers).

```vue [pages/login.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const user = useSupabaseUser()
const client = useSupabaseClient()
const router = useRouter()

// Login method using providers
const login = async (provider: 'github' | 'google' | 'gitlab' | 'bitbucket') => {
  const { error } = await client.auth.signIn(provider)

  if (error) {
    return alert('Something went wrong !')
  }

  router.push('/dashboard')
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="login('github')">Login with GitHub</button>
</template>
```

<alert type="info">

Thanks to the [Nuxt plugin](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/plugins), we are listening to the [onAuthStateChange](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-onauthstatechange) listener in order to update the user value according to the received event. We also keep the session consistency between client and server side.

 2. Database Request

Please check [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/select) documentation to fully use the power of Supabase client.

Here is an example of a fetch using the `select` method with Nuxt 3 [useAsyncData](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/usage/data-fetching#useasyncdata) composable.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const user = useSupabaseUser()
const client = useSupabaseClient()

const { data: restaurant } } = await useAsyncData('restaurant', async () => {
  const { data } = await client.from('restaurants').select('name, location').eq('name', 'My Restaurant Name').single()

  return data
})
</script>
```

### `useSupabaseUser`

Once logged in, you can access your user everywhere:

```vue
<script setup>
const user = useSupabaseUser()
</script>
```

> Learn how to protect your routes by writing your own [auth middleware composable](/advanced#auth-middleware).

## Server routes services

> This section assumes you're familiar with [Nitro](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/server-engine#standalone-server), the server engine powered by Nuxt.

In order to provide utilities similar to `vue` composables (see first section) in [server routes](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/features/server-routes/), this module exposes services providing the same functionnalities.

### `serverSupabaseClient`

This function is working similary as the [useSupabaseClient](/usage#usesupabaseclient) composable but can be used in server routes.

Define your server route and just use the `serverSupabaseClient` like:

```ts [server/api/librairies.ts]
export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const client = serverSupabaseClient(event)

  const { data } = client.from('librairies').select('name')

  return { librairies: data }
})
```

Then call your api route from any vue file:

```ts [pages/index.vue]
const callSupabaseClientInServerRoute = async () => {
  const { librairies } = await $fetch('/api/librairies')
}
```

### `serverSupabaseUser`

This function is working similary as the [useSupabaseUser](/usage#usesupabaseuser) composable but can be used in server routes.

Define your server route and just use the `serverSupabaseUser` like:

```ts [server/api/me.ts]
export default eventHandler(async (event) => {
  const user = await serverSupabaseUser(event)

  return { user }
})
```

Then call your api route from any vue file:


```ts [pages/index.vue]
const getSupabaseUserFromServerRoute = async () => {
  const { user } = await $fetch('/api/me')
}
```
